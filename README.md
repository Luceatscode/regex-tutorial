# Regex Tutorial

## Description 


### This regex tutorial aims to give a brief overview of regular expression or regex for short. I cover different components giving a short explanation of what the component does, characters you would use to utilize the component, and a code snippet giving an example of how it would look written out. Go through the table of contents and check them all out!

## Usage


### Once you open my project with vs code you want to open a preview of the gist-template.md and you will then be able to use the table of contents to take you to each component.

## Contributing


### Along with using rexegg.com to research each component, my developer friend working at Amazon (@joeybuenosdias on GitHub) helped me understand each component better by breaking it down in a simplified way so I can understand regex better. If there are mistakes please reach out so I can correct them! I am a newbie afterall!
