## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are special characters used in regular expressions to match specific positions within a string. They do not match any actual characters, but rather represent positions in the text. Anchors are useful for ensuring that a pattern is found at a specific location in the input string.

- ^ (caret): Matches the start of a string.
- $ (dollar): Matches the end of a string.

```
const regex = /^Hello/;
console.log(regex.test('Hello, World!')); // Output: true
